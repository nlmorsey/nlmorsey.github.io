        <h1>Reflections on Software Testing</h1>
        <p>Here are some of the things that I have learned, thanks to people who have been kind enough to talk to me about software testing.</p>
        <h4>Qualities of an excellent software tester:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>collaborative: works as part of a team, not alone; prioritizes group not self</li>
            <li>curious: explores, asks questions, pays attention, learns constantly</li>
            <li>attentive: notices small details that could lead to important problems</li>
            <li>thorough: gathers enough details about the software in order to test it effectively</li>
            <li>committed: seeks above all else to "break" the software, looks for edge cases</li>
            <li>analytical: solves problems, thinks through a test case from beginning to end</li>
            <li>clear: communicates precisely, and clearly explains how to replicate bugs so as to save developers time</li>
            <li>persuasive: advocates the resolution of important bugs</li>
            <li>concise</li>
            <li>assertive: speaks up</li>
            <li>diplomatic: talks about bugs and brings up issues sensitively</li>
            <li>respectful: understands where the developers are coming from</li>
            <li>honest: promises only what can be delivered and represents accurately what has been tested</li>
            <li>enthusiastic: stays engaged</li>
            <li>organized: prioritizes the most important tests and the most important bugs</li>
            <li>ethical: can make the right judgment calls</li>
            <li>value-driven: prioritizes the customer</li>
            <li>empathetic: respects developers and designers</li>
            <li>educated: understands the product, and keeps up-to-date on software testing</li>
            <li>communicative: asks questions, asks for more information, and brings up issues early enough during the project</li>
            <li>reflective: learns from experience</li>
            <li>efficient: able to test the most important things first and frontline the most urgent bugs</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        <h4>Testlio 3/5/18</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>I signed up for Testlio! I noticed that they put a priority on client privacy, which is great.</li>
            <li>They also have rules for testers.</li>
            <li>They rate testers based on quality of work.</li>
            <li>Also, they remove testers based on whether or not testers follow community guidelines.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
