        <p>Here are some of the things that I have learned, thanks to people who have been kind enough to talk to me about software testing.</p>
        <p>It is important to want to "break" the software and look for edges cases. You need curiosity. 
        Good software testers are analytical and problem-solvers. They can think through the software and how to test it.
        Good software testers ask a lot of questions. They make sure to know enough about the details to test effectively.
        Good software testers are assertive. They are not afraid to ask for information, or to bring up bugs.
        Good software testers are diplomatic. They work as a team. They understand where the developers are coming from.
        Good software testers are honest. They do not promise what they cannot deliver, or misrepresent what they have tested.
        Good software testers are always learning. They keep up to date on software practices, learn about the software they are testing,
        and learn from experience.
        Good software testers don't exaggerate what they can do. 
        Good software testers know about code, but don't try to do the job of the developers or the designers.
        Good software testers put the customer and the product quality first, not cutting corners.
        Good software testers are enthusiastic, engaged, and have a can-do attitude. 
        Good software testers are bug advocates. </p>
