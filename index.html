        <p>Here are some of the things that I have learned, thanks to people who have been kind enough to talk to me about software testing.</p>
        <p>An excellent software tester seeks above all things to "break" the software: she looks for edge cases.<br/> 
        She solves problems. She thinks from beginning to end: gathering, planning, testing, and assessing.<br/>
        She asks many questions. She ensures that she knows enough about the details of the software in order to test it effectively.<br/>
        She is not afraid to ask for information.<br/>
        She speaks up.<br/>
        She works as part of a team. She understands where the developers are coming from.<br/>
        She does not promise what she cannot deliver, or misrepresent what she has tested.<br/>
        She is always learning. She keeps up to date on software practices, and learns about the software she is testing,
        and learns from experience.<br/>
        She doesn't exaggerate what she can do.<br/>
        She knows about code, but doesn't try to do the job of the developers or the designers.<br/>
        She puts the customer and the product quality first, and she does not cut corners.<br/>
        She is engaged, and has a can-do attitude.<br/>
        She advocates the resolution of bugs. </p>
